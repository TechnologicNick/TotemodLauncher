Currently pretty much just a user interface. I'm currently working on [TechnologicNick/SMInjector](https://github.com/TechnologicNick/SMInjector), which will later be integrated into this.

Uses [TechnologicNick/totemod-core](https://github.com/TechnologicNick/totemod-core) for all the mod(pack) handling.
